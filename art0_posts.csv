"the key is light layers. A big mistake a lot of people make is starting off with one of the BIG sets of colored pencils that have almost any color you can think of. A smaller pack of them will help with learning to use layers to get the color/saturation you want. Also, the blending pencils are great, but I like to go a little darker with my base layers, then use a white colored pencil to blend/lighten.

Also, yes, paper is a big factor. You want something that has a good tooth to it, but not too much. There is a balance. If you are using printer style paper, its going to look like crayons. If you use too toothy of a paper, you knock down a lot of that tooth and wont be able to blend as well.","Strawberry, Me, Colored Pencils, 2017",caf74m,hot,12.0,,"['You need to learn to accept criticism.
