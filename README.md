# Reddit_Comment_Scraper_To_Csv
This repo is supposed to get a list of all comments in a reddit thread and the direct replies to those comments and put them into a csv.

The art0.csv is supposed to be an example of the format you can expect with this code.

 **The Dependencies are:** 

  praw
  
  pandas
  
  Pyhton 3 -> Besides print statements very little would likely need to be changed for Python2.7

**TO DO:** As You can see from the image, Reddit has some alphanumerics that do not play well with python or Praw, I will need to work on that 
to get higher quality data for ML projects
