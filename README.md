# Reddit_Comment_Scraper_To_Csv
This repo is supposed to get a list of all comments in a reddit thread and the direct replies to those comments and put them into a csv.

The art0.csv is supposed to be an example of the format you can expect with this code.

The Dependencies are: 
  praw
  pandas
  Pyhton 3 -> Besides print statements very little would likely need to be changed for Python2.7
